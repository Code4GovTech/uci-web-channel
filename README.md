# Unified Communication Interface

## About UCI

The Unified Communications Interface (UCI) aims to democratize the use of different communication channels such as WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, email and more for governance use cases through a standard configurable manner that is reusable and scalable across all governance use cases.

## Features

- Ability to connect to any communication channel through any service provider without doing custom changes in the core logic UCI.
- The UCI ecosystem is independent of external variables like communication channel and service provider powered by XMessage standard.
- Ability to have a configurable conversation logic for the bot
- Ability to connect to any database (local or federated) via services
- Ability to include value added services in the bot interaction flow through Microservices (Internal or External)
- Ability to create tools on top of UCI APIs to manage Bot configuration, conversations and visualization
